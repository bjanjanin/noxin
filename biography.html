					<p><b>Noxin</b> is a five-piece band from Hrvatsko Zagorje, Croatia, formed in <b>2001</b> after the disbandment of <b>The Lost</b>. Members include <strong>Sebastijan Fuštin</strong> (vocals), <strong>Emil Gredičak</strong> (guitar), <strong>Mladen Barbić</strong> (bass), <strong>Vedran Medić</strong> (drums) and <strong>Robert Kuščar</strong> (keyboards).</p>
					<p>The lineup was complete after the band persuaded <b>Emil Gredičak</b> (The Lost) to rejoin his old friends after eight years. A single lineup change has been made after that point, when <b>Goran Popović</b> was replaced by <b>Tomislav Piljek</b>. Goran went on to pursue his interests in other musical projects as well as photography. <b>Tomislav Piljek</b> (Thee Larche) stepped in, which was another wish come true for the band. The second vocalist, <b>Darko Kopajtić</b>, withdrew from the active lineup at the very beginnings. Due to many family and school obligations, Noxin have not recorded a lot of material to his date. From the live appearances, the majority of which took place in Zagorje, the gig at the <b>Antidora</b> festival in 2001 in Tvornica, Zagreb is certainly worth mentioning. So are the gigs on the farewell tour of <b>Shamrock Rovers</b> in <b>Sax</b>, <b>Aquarius</b> and <b>Pauk</b> in Zagreb in September and October of 2003, then the gig on the <b>Tabor Film Festival</b> in Tuheljske Toplice with <b>Gustafi</b>, and the tenth annual <b>HGF</b> festival in Bedekovčina.</p>
					<p>Noxin is known for collaborating with many of their musician friends. <em>Loše vijesti</em> features <b>Ivanka Mazurkijević</b> (Stampedo), <b>Davorin Bogović</b> sang in <em>RS 110S</em>, <b>Arieb Azhar</b> (Shamrock Rovers) sang in <em>Priča o velikoj grešci</em>, <b>Jakša Kriletić Jordes</b> (Jinx, Ihthis) plays the saxophone in <em>Zašto pametni nikad nisu u modi</em>, while <b>Tomislav Goluban</b> (Little Pigeon's ForHill Blues) plays the harmonica in <em>Mito i korupcija</em>. <b>Miro Odak</b> (Krug) was the guest vocalist in Stakleni grad and <b>Nikola Ćeran</b> plays the violin in <em>Sjene</em>. <b>Maja Posavec</b> (Detour) was the last to enter the studio with Noxin to record <em>Da ljubav je</em>. <b>Ljudevit Grgurić Grga</b>, a well known radio and TV personality also lent his voice for one of the tracks on the album.</p>
					<p>The band is currently working on the material for the new album and plays at selected concerts.</p>
